00 *Final* design brings up all necesary features.
00 Final Design -> Thanks to *simplification* programs Ford's engine had 25% fewer parts. 
00 Final Design -> Thanks to *value analysis (value engineering)* it can be achieved that the function of a product at less cost.
00 Final Design -> *Safety and legal properness* : Conserned with issued related to ease of use (usability) and the safety of the product.
00 Final Design -> *Product liability* : State regulations concerning pollution, safety, drug prohibitions, and so on also impact product design.
00 Final Design -> *Reliability* is the probability that a product will perform in a satisfactory manner for a given period of time under specific (normal) operating conditions.
00 Final Design -> Considering reliability of a product we separate items that are consumed *one-time-use(Food,paper) or reusable(car,toaster)* products.
00 Final Design parts -> *Simplification and Value Analysis* -> Safety and Legal Properness -> Product Liability -> Reliability -> Availability (MTBF / MBTF + MTTR)  -> usability -> manufacturability (design for manufacture) -> design for environment -> design for EPR -> design for robustness. 
00 Process Design Stage -> From the discussions so far, it is clear that there is a close relationship between *the design of the product and the design of the production system* to make the product.
00 Final Design -> *Design for robustness* : Product designed to withstand variations in environmental and operating conditions (outer noise)
00 *Simplification* programs reduce the number of separate parts and operations to produce a product .
00 Concerned with issues related to ease of use *(usability)* and the safety of the product .
00 Product *liability* is a major concern of firms because of civil lawsuits restricting the firms.
00 *Reliability * is the probability that a product will perform in a satisfactory manner for a given period of time under specific (normal) operating conditions .
00 *Reusable * products consist of a number of subcomponents that must all function properly for the product to work reliably.
00 lambda=1/sigma is the *failure* rate.
00 Rs= R1xR2xR3 formulation is valid in *series* case.
00 Mean time between failures are *MTBF*.
00 *System availability* is MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR).
00 *manufacturability*: a major design consideration -
00 *design* engineers are no longer unlimited in how they design parts and products.
00 *EPR* holds companies responsible for their product even after its useful life.
00 Process Design :Design engineers must also specify certain *tolerance* limits.
00 Process Design :*Explosion* chart  to see all its parts and how they fit together, together with a completed view of the finished product .
00 *Assembly* chart  more detailed assembly instructions than the explosion chart and includes subassemblies as well. 
00 Each of the pen’s parts will have a *blueprint* describing the construction of the part or else purchase specifications if the part is to be bought outside.
00 *Route sheets*: showing each operation for each of the parts needed to produce the product; department where the operation is to be done; operation time needed; the equipment to be used for the operation; test procedures required.
00 To analyze the cartridge subassembly task for possible improvements, use the *flow process* chart.
00 System Availability or Maintainability is = *MeanTimeBetweenFailures / (MeanTimeBetweenFailures + MeanTimeToRepair)*.
00 Preliminary Design : *Tradeoff analysis* = The design task is to trade off these characteristics in order to best meet the demands.
