00 Facility Location : uncapacitated fixed-charge facility location problem -> The problem makes location decisions for a *single echelon*, and the facilities in that echelon are assumed to serve facilities in a downstream echelon, all of whose locations are fixed.
00 uncapacitated fixed-charge facility location problem : Each potential facility (say DC) location has a *fixed cost* that represents building (or leasing) the facility; the fixed cost is independent of the volume that passes through the DC.
00 uncapacitated fixed-charge facility location problem : DCs have *no capacity restrictions*; any amount of product can be handled by any DC.
00 uncapacitated fixed-charge facility location problem : The problem: to choose facility (DC) locations to minimize the fixed cost of building facilities *plus* the transportation cost to transport product from DCs to customers, subject to constraints requiring every customer to be served by some open DC.
00 uncapacitated fixed-charge facility location problem's Formulated Model's Objection Function : *fixed cost of building facilities + transportation cost to transport product from DCs to customers*.
00 uncapacitated fixed-charge facility location problem : 'transportation cost to transport product from DCs to customers'  = *annualdemandofcustomer x thefractionofcustomer_i_demandthatisservedbyfacility_j x costtotransportoneunitfromfacility_j_tocustomer_i*.
00 uncapacitated fixed-charge facility location problem : It is always optimal to assign each customer solely to its nearest open facility therefore there always exists an optimal solution in which yij E{0,1} for all i and j that is called *single sourcing*.
00 capacitated fixed-charge facility location problem : Bu problemin modelini kurarken bize *DC'lerin dağıtım yapabileceği maksimum sayı (limiti vi is the maximum demand that can be served by facility i) lazım* , bunu da modele bir constraint olarak ekliyoruz...
00 The uncapacitated formulation can easily be modified to  account for capacity restrictions. The resulting problem is called *the capacitated fixed-charge location problem*.
00 *Facility Location p-median problem* : These problems are intended to find the median points among the candidate points, so that the sum of costs (or distances only) can be minimized.
00 *Facility location p-median problem* : Örneğin 10 adet alternatif DC location noktası var ve bize p = 4 olarak verilmiş . Bir constraint ekleyerek açılan DC'leri 4 ile kısıtlandırıyoruz.
00 Facility Location - *Locating Pure Service Organizations* (legal advice , education , medical examination).
00 Locating Pure Service Organizations -> Recipient to Facility -> Examples of facilities: *fire, police, ambulance*. 
00 In *locating Pure Service Organizations* two general (extreme) cases encountered : 1- High-density demand for a single station but with multiple vehicles (VRP) 2-Widely distributed (sparse) demand for distributed multiple stations (ATM , PostOffice).
00 Pure Service organizasyonlarını yerleştirirken *tesis sayısının artması* her tesisin kendi başına önemini yitirmesine sebep olur yani tek bir tesis çok önemli iken bu tesis sayısı 100'e çıkarsa her tesisin önemi 100 tesise dağılır (diminishing marginal returns).
00 Pure Service konumunu belirlerken yapılan *incremental approach* servisin kalitesinin zayıflamasına sebep olur. Adım adım , teker teker yapılan bu eklemeler yapıldığında sonucumuzun kalitesi TÜM TESİSLERİ SIFIRDAN KONUMLANDIRMAya kıyasla çok daha az olacaktır.
